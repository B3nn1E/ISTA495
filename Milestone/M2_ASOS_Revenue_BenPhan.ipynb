    "So, a little bit comment about my code above. As you have seen instead of using the sum() function, I went the long road instead and did 3 more for loops for my total. I have tried an hour debugging this but I can't, the 'int' object is callable for me is impossible to find. I have looked up Google to see why I have that mistake and apparently, that mistake only pops up if I use one of the build-in function to name a variable, which I apparently did. However, after knowing this error, I have changed all my \"sum\" variables into \"total\" right away, but the error is still there. I know that the problem is with the sum since max and min still work just fine. I even used ctrl+ f to search all the \"sum\" keywords in my code and I can't find it. What more frustrating is that my code works well in another coding tool (if you are curious, I ran my code on Replit and it works just fine)! So I gave up, I will just do the long way here. Forgive me for my inefficency in coding. I also tried not to repeat printing and calculating the same thing for each months but whenever I write a new code, it always ended up longer than intended (I used while loop and if/else statement to try to append them into a new list and so on). At the end, so much time wasted and I accomplished nothing. Please, I beg you to find the cause of the \"callable\" bug since that one drove me to the edge of insanity. Also, please forgive me for ranting like this and I hope I still get full credits for my work here still because of the correct results at least. "
